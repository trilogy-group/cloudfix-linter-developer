# Cloudfix-linter

## Who is the product for

The product is for anyone who uses terraform to manage their AWS infrastructure and would like to know how best they can optimise their cloud infrastucture in order to save costs.

## What is the product

It is a command line tool that flags optimisation oppurtunities detected by Cloudfix for the resources that have been deployed using terraform. It'll either flag the specific attribute within the resource that needs to be changed (along with what it needs to be changed to), or in the case that such an attribute does not exist, describe the oppurtunity against the name of the resource about which the oppurtunity is present. It will identify the resources deployed by remote modules and provide recommendations for them.

## Pre-requisites to use the product

1. An active cloudfix account at https://app.cloudfix.com/
2. Resources deployed on AWS using terraform for which you would like to see reccomendations.

## Usage guide
#### 1. Run command 
- Windows
```
Invoke-WebRequest -URI https://github.com/trilogy-group/cloudfix-linter/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; ./install.ps1 (pwd).path
```
- Linux and Devspaces
```bash
wget -O - https://github.com/trilogy-group/cloudfix-linter/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
 ```


#### 2. Ensure that terraform can access your AWS account. You can user one of the following:

- Devconnect with [saml2aws](https://github.com/Versent/saml2aws)
- Set the access key and the secret key inside of the provider "aws" block eg: in the main.tf file provider "aws" { region = "us-east-1" access_key = "my-access-key" secret_key = "my-secret-key" } 
- Set and export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID , AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY , AWS_SESSION_TOKEN as enviroment variables. More information on how to give access can be found [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs).

#### 3. Cloudfix Credentials
This version works with CloudFix v3 so make sure you have credentials to https://app.cloudfix.com/

#### 4. From your terraform code working directory do "cloudfix-linter init".
```bash
cd my-terraform-project
cloudfix-linter init
cloudfix-linter --help
```

#### 5. Run "terraform apply" to deploy the resources from your terraform code working directory.
```bash
terraform apply
```

#### 6. To get recommendations from cloudfix and see them through CLI run command 
```
cloudfix-linter recco
```

Note :- If you make any changes to your terraform code, You first have to deploy them using “terraform apply” and then run “cloudfix-linter” command again through working directory of your terraform code to see reccomendations being flagged according to recent changes. 

Note:- If you do not have terraform code template to test this tool. You can use [this](https://github.com/trilogy-group/cloudfixLinter-demo) demo


## Guide on how to add support for new Cloudfix Oppurtunity Types:

A pure json mapping has been made so that support for new insights can be added easily.
Sample mapping json:

```
{
		"Gp2Gp3": {
			"Attribute Type": "type",
			"Attribute Value": "gp3"
		},
		"Ec2IntelToAmd": {
			"Attribute Type": "instance_type",
			"Attribute Value": "parameters.Migrating to instance type"
		},
		"StandardToSIT": {
			"Attribute Type": "NoAttributeMarker",
			"Attribute Value": "Enable Intelligent Tiering for this S3 Block by writing a aws_s3_bucket_intelligent_tiering_configuration resource block"
		},
		"EfsInfrequentAccess": {
			"Attribute Type": "NoAttributeMarker",
			"Attribute Value": "Enable Intelligent Tiering for EFS File by declaring a sub-block called lifecycle_policy within this resource block"
		}
}
```
Detailed mapping can be viewed [here](https://github.com/trilogy-group/cloudfix-linter/blob/6ed0a514dc3dd8c865f81e2dcddda456d3012fca/cloudfixIntegration/cloudfixManager.go#L221).

For each new oppurtunity type, create a new block in the json by its name. If the opportunity type targets an attribute in specific, put in the name of the attribute for the Attribute Type. If it does not target any attribute, put in "NoAttributeMarker" instead. For the Attribute Value, if that needs to picked up from the parameters field of the cloudfix recommendation, set that as parameters.{Name of field within parameters block} (for reference take a look at the block for Ec2IntelToAmd). In case the value for the attribute is static and need not be picked up from the parameters field, it can be hardcoded directly in the json (for reference take a look at the block for Gp2Gp3). If the oppurtunity type does not target any attribute in specific, for the attribute value, put in the message that you want displayed to the user (for reference see the block for EfsInfrequentAccess)

This mapping is currently part of the code itself, but can be easily hosted online. 


## Contributing

The project uses a custom ruleset written for [TfLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/architecture.md) to flag reccomendations from cloudfix. The github repo for the ruleset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/trilogy-group/tflint-ruleset-template)
